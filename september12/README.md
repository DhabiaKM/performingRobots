## Reading Response 
### (Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in Love.)


**Questions**

why are people so adamant to make robots look more like humans?



**Observations**

What I found really interesting in this reading is how they gave us examples of different robots that imitate intimacy or human-like emotions and discussing how these robots look and how that affects our perception of their actions. The chapter starts by introducing us to Bjork's music video as an example of the use of robotics in a not so conventional way (they are not used for produtcion or as a commodity), but they are used to showcase intimacy where they embrace each other. The robots in the music video resemble humans, and so in a way our perception of their intimacy sort of makes sense and is not all that weird. But what if this type of intimacy or love was portrayed thorugh robots that do not really resemble humans? One would think that it would not make sense at all and that it wouldnt really allow us to connect to it the way we would if the robots were more human-like. And that is when the example of Velonaki's Fish and Bird come into play. There were many renditions of the performance, where the robots took different forms like wheel chairs and small boxes. But was fascinating is how the work showed us that robots do not need to take a human-like form to communicate intimacy. The messages that they exchange with one another, and the smallest details of having them look handwritten was enough to allow the audience to connect with the two objects and undertstand that there is something connecting them with one another. 



**Reaction**

I really enjoyed this reading and the many examples it brings up on performing robots and how it discusses themes related to the construction of robots and how they look and how that affects our perception.
