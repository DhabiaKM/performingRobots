## Reading Response


The reading discusses various examples of 'puppotics' or performing robots, and the different types of communications that can be utilized to essentially entertain an audience through their performance.

In the reading it is also mentioned how physical implementations of perfroming agents are the most entertaining and engaging. I don't really know how to feel about that statement though. I believe that virtual agents and physical agents are both equally entertaining and engaging. 

I sometimes find myself being more engaged with virtual agents than phsyical ones because they can take any shape or form or look. They can be literally anything we want them to be, and so there is no limit to what they can look like. They can almost always look appealing and interesting for the audience. With physical agents however, its kind of limited sometimes, and thats why I personally wouldnt always engage with them. But then again there are some attributes to virtual agents that don't work as well, and I feel that would be along the lines of utilizing the sense of touch with the interaction.

So, I guess the only thing that I would disagree with in the reading is that audiences can have equal immediate rapport with both phsyical and animated puppets or agents.
