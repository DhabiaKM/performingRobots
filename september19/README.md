### On Stage: Robots as Performers


**Questions**

Is it really necessary for a robot to be fluent in action coordination and timing for us to interact with it?
Does a robot have to have human qualities for us to interact with it?



**Observations**

This is a really interesting reading that shows us how the performative arts help robotocists delve deeper into the way their robot interacts with other people and how that interaction could be fruitful. What sort of bothers me a little with this reading is how adamant the authors are over the fact that a robot would only leave an impression on people if it interacted in a humanly and timed sort of way. It is interesting, dont get me wrong, seeing robots imitate something that seems impossible for a machine to imitate, but at the same time I always wonder if it is truly necessary. I had the same thoughts even with the other reading, there seems to be an obsession with creating human-like robots and that if they look and act like humans that is the only way we can ever interact with them. But I completely disagree. Humans are not that shallow where they can only form relationships and interact with other like-minded and similar looking things. Some people form far greater relationships with animals than they do with other people, I feel that that goes to show how it doesnt really matter what the thing we're interacting with looks like or how it acts. 


**Reaction**

Very intersting reading. It brings up great points on how performative arts helps with the development of interactive robots. Plus it brings up interesting examples. I'm just not so convinced that what they propose is really necessary.
